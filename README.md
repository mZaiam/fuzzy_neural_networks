# Fuzzy Neural Networks
This repository has some implementations about fuzzy theory and fuzzy neural networks, involving my undergraduate research project, oriented by PhD Vinicius Francisco Wasques. The goal of the project is to explore the ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) architecture for explainable AI models. There is currently one folder in this GitHub: FuzzyNumbers. 

The folder is an implementation about fuzzy numbers, which was done in the beggining of my project. I am currently working on an implementation of an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), based on [simpful](https://github.com/aresio/simpful) module for fuzzy reasoning in Python. Some of the results I got using my ANFIS implementation is on folder ANFIS (the source code is not available yet, as I am still working on it).
