# Fuzzy Neural Networks
This repository has some implementations about fuzzy theory and fuzzy neural networks, involving my undergraduate research project, oriented by PhD Vinicius Francisco Wasques. The goal of the project is to explore the ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System) architecture for explainable AI models. There are two folders in this GitHub: FuzzyNumbers and ANFIS. The first one is an implementation about fuzzy numbers, which was done in the beggining of my project; and the second is an implementation Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), based on [simpful](https://github.com/aresio/simpful) modeule for fuzzy reasoning in Python.
